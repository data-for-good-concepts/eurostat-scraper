> _⚠️ Please note, that the documentation of this project is still 
**Work In Progress**. The description might be incomplete and is subject to 
constant change._  

The **Eurostat Scraper** is a working example on how to wrap a web scraper in a 
web service and deploy it on the cloud using R. This project aims to showcase 
different aspects when it comes to web scraping in general, as well as different
technologies when deploying your work in production.

This example scrapes the _'Asylum applicants by type of applicant, citizenship, age and sex - monthly data'_ from the [**Eurostat Data Browser**](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/MIGR_ASYAPPCTZM/default/table?lang=en). 
The scraper can be triggered by a `POST` request to the API endpoint in which 
the scraper is wrapped in, and it returns the scraped data as part of the 
`response` object. Even though this example has been developed to scrape one 
particular dataset, any other dataset that is available as part of the
**Eurostat Data Browser** can be scraped with little to no adjustments.

Following tools and technologies will be highlighted or are heavily in use as 
part of this example - `RSelenium`, `plumber`, `Docker`, `Google Cloud Build`, 
`Google Cloud Run` and `GitHub Actions`.

### Usage

In case you are running the scraping service locally, make sure you start the 
web service by executing following command in your R console. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
source('src/server.R')
```

#### Trigger scraping job

Start a scraping job by making a `POST` request to the trigger endpoint. 
When you are working locally, replace `<URL>` with `localhost:8080`. When you 
have the web service deployed on Google Cloud Run, use your Cloud Run service 
URL.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
curl --location --request POST '<URL>/api/v1/scraper/job'
```

As a response the scraping service will return the requested dataset as `JSON`.

```{js, eval=FALSE}
[
    {
        "DATAFLOW": "ESTAT:MIGR_ASYAPPCTZM(1.0)",
        "LAST UPDATE": "11/11/22 23:00:00",

    {
        "DATAFLOW": "ESTAT:MIGR_ASYAPPCTZM(1.0)",
        "LAST UPDATE": "11/11/22 23:00:00",
        "freq": "M",
        "unit": "PER",
        "citizen": "UA",
        "sex": true,
        "age": "Y14-17",
        "asyl_app": "ASY_APP",
        "geo": "AT",
        "TIME_PERIOD": "2022-01",
        "OBS_VALUE": 0
    },
    ...
]
```

### Deployment

In order to run this web service on Google Cloud, please make sure you have a
[Google Cloud Account](https://cloud.google.com/) and have the 
[`Cloud Build API`](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/cloudbuild.googleapis.com) 
and the [`Cloud Run API`](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/run.googleapis.com) 
enabled. In order to deploy this service from the command line, will further
need to install the [`gcloud CLI`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).

> _⚠️ Documentation on IAM permissions need to be added. Further documentation 
on Service Account usage and permissions is currently missing._  

You can deploy this service on Google Cloud by executing the following command 
in the command line. Make sure to replace `<REGION>` with the 
[Google Cloud region](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones), 
you want to use for the deployment of your web service.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
gcloud builds submit --region='<REGION>'
```

In case you want to modify deployment parameters, feel free to adjust the 
`cloudbuild.yaml` according to your needs.
